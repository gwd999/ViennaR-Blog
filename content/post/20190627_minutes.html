<h2>R in corporate enivroments (finance depts.)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walterdjuric/"><strong>Walter Djuric</strong></a></p>
<p>A short presentation, on the potential and real life uses of R (and RStudio) in a typical business (ie Accounting) department in a large Austrian financial institution.<br />
Common pitfalls (mostly linked to infrastructure problems eg firewalls, non-admin user-rights, AV software, etc) are discussed and a short overview of tactics for coping with these challenges is given (eg set up a local CRAN, package building so that R newbies can utilize it, enhanced <code>.Rprofiles</code>, etc).</p>
<p>You can find the <strong>html slides/pages</strong> of his presentation <a href="/slides/VR-2019-06-27_WDpres.html">here</a>.</p>
