A **sparklyr** introduction by Roland Boubela.

<!--more-->

The October Meetup was hosted by Roland Boubela who gave an excellent talk about the new **sparklyr** package. **sparklyr** provides an easy-to-use interface to Apache Spark and can even be accessed using the latest and greatest version of RStudio ([preview release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview)). It also covered a comparison with the existing **SparkR** package.
