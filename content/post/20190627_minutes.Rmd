## R in corporate enivroments (finance depts.) 
[**Walter Djuric**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walterdjuric/)

A short presentation, on the potential and real life uses of R (and RStudio) in a typical business (ie Accounting) department in a large Austrian financial institution.     
Common pitfalls (mostly linked to infrastructure problems eg firewalls, non-admin user-rights, AV software, etc) are discussed and a short overview of tactics for  coping with these challenges is given (eg set up a local CRAN, package building so that R newbies can utilize it, enhanced `.Rprofiles`, etc).
