<p>For the first 2020 meetup we gathered in late February, just days before R’s official 20 year birthday.<br />
The great location this time was <a href="https://www.ibm.com/at-de">IBM Austria’s headoffice</a> in the heart of Vienna and drinks and snacks were generously provided by the hosts.</p>

<h3>TALK ONE (Thomas, Thomas and Rudolf)</h3>
<p>The first presentation was held by IBM’s own (and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/">ViennaR meetup</a> member) <a href="https://at.linkedin.com/in/strehl-thomas-122867110">Thomas [Strehl]</a>, <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Thomas_Weinrich3">Thomas [Weinrich]</a> and <a href="https://at.linkedin.com/in/rudolfpailer">Rudolf [Pailer]</a>.</p>
<p>The talk focused on how R based machine learning can be brought into an enterprise environment. Starting from organizational and security related challenges, the industry proven CRSIP-DM model was used as a workhorse to apply MLOps principles to a REST API based machine learning architecture. The CRISPML sample implementation demonstrated rshiny and plumber docker images deployed to a kubernetes cluster on a tekton pipeline, and a performance testing setup including k6/loadimpact, influxdb and grafana. The slides including screenshots of the demo can be found at <a href="/slides/REnterprise-Deck_20200227.pdf">REnterprise</a>.</p>

<h3>TALK TWO (Mario)</h3>
<p>The second speaker was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-annau-a68b2056/">Mario Annau</a> (Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.quantargo.com">Quantargo</a>). Mario introduced us to a different approach towards R in production without the need for Docker containers.<br />
His first solution he was showing was <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/connect">RStudio Connect</a> which also covers the deployment process via one push button functionality from the <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download">RStudio Editor</a>.<br />
He finished his talk with a gentle introduction to <a href="https://www.quantargo.com/qbits">QBits</a> to deploy R functions based on serverless technologies within seconds.</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone for attending and IBM for being such great hosts. Hope to see you all again soon at our next Meetup in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/events/269180461">March</a>.</p>
