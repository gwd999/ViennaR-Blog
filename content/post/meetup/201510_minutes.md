After a fruitful discussion regarding the future direction of the R User Group just a little summary of the **HOT** topics. The discussion started  with a very nice and detailed introduction of new *ViennaR* participants and was followed by an interesting and---as expected and encouraged---controversial discussion about project goals, project management and topics.

## Organisation
Our goal is to have monthly Meetups. Currently they are scheduled by the end of each month, however, this may change depending on the availability of the room. A big thank you to [Matthias](http://www.statistik.tuwien.ac.at/public/templ) who makes this Meetup at the Institute of Computational Statistics [1] possible! 

[1] At the legendary *Goldenes Lamm*, birthplace at/of [e1071](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/index.html).

## Presentations
Like in previous Meetups we are happy to have some presentations of *ViennaR* participants. Just drop us a mail that you are planning a presentation during one of the next meetups. We would also be happy to invite some guest speakers from time to time.

## Projects
To have an even more collaborative experience during *ViennaR* Meetups plan to have different projects on our [Github](https://github.com/viennar) page. It should be manageable to have up to 5 people working on specific projects with an expected duration of about 3 Months.
The following project streams have been selected and coordinators assigned:

- [Fantasy Sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport), e.g. from Yahoo (short intro/write--up by Daniel)
	- Put team together based on statistics, e.g. Baseball
	- References:
	  - Book: [Analyzing Baseball data in R](http://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Baseball-Data-Chapman-Series/dp/1466570229)
	  - [Scraping Fantasy Football Projections from the Web](http://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/2014/06/scraping-fantasy-football-projections.html)
- Parliamentary voting results (input from Mateusz)
	- Harvesting data, e.g. [Beschlüsse des Nationalrats](https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/1a3c44a8-7361-4dc7-ac0d-6ec19ddba191) from https://www.data.gv.at
	- Visualization
- Text mining (Mario)
	- Public newspapers
	- Most popular words in Newspapers
	- HC Strache Posts on Facebook
- Use Kaggle as an Inspiration (Walter)
	- Hillary Clintons E-mails

We will use the [Meetup Discussion Forum](http://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/messages/boards/forum/2693272) to futher elaborate on [Project ideas](http://www.meetup.com/ViennaR/messages/boards/thread/49348746).

## Other Topics
We would also be happy to have some other fixed discussion topics, e.g. book presentations, new R packages around, etc...
Just let us know!

## Next Steps
For the next meetup we are planning a short Git(hub) and R package dev intro (Mario) and hope that each assigned coordinator can give us a little heads up of her topic.

Looking forward to see you at the next meetup in November!
