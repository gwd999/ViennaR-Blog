<p>After a fruitful discussion regarding the future direction of the R User Group just a little summary of the <strong>HOT</strong> topics. The discussion started with a very nice and detailed introduction of new <em>ViennaR</em> participants and was followed by an interesting and—as expected and encouraged—controversial discussion about project goals, project management and topics.</p>
