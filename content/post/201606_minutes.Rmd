## Rainer Stuetz: igraph Applications
Rainer presented interesting [igraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html) applications with an example to extract (clean) subnetworks, e.g. motorways, from the Austrian [graph integration platform](http://gip.gv.at). The routing graph was parsed using the [readr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html) package and pre-processed with [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html). For the extraction of the subnetworks, shortest path algorithms from igraph were used.
