      <description>For the first 2020 meetup we gathered in late February, just days before R’s official 20 year birthday.
The great location this time was IBM Austria’s headoffice in the heart of Vienna and drinks and snacks were generously provided by the hosts.
TALK ONE (Thomas, Thomas and Rudolf) The first presentation was held by IBM’s own (and ViennaR meetup member) Thomas [Strehl], Thomas [Weinrich] and Rudolf [Pailer].
The talk focused on how R based machine learning can be brought into an enterprise environment.</description>

Peter presented Alteryx, a platform built for Business Analysts to master tasks like data management, data cleaning and modelling. The tool is windows only and will be ported to Linux soon. It can connect to multiple data sources and helps Business Analysts to deploy models in production. Finally, Peter also showed a Demo including data ingestion, an example of the Facebook Face API and some community features.</description>
