      <description>For the first 2020 meetup we gathered in late February, just days before R’s official 20 year birthday.
The great location this time was IBM Austria’s headoffice in the heart of Vienna and drinks and snacks were generously provided by the hosts.
TALK ONE (Thomas, Thomas and Rudolf) The first presentation was held by IBM’s own (and ViennaR meetup member) Thomas [Strehl], Thomas [Weinrich] and Rudolf [Pailer].
The talk focused on how R based machine learning can be brought into an enterprise environment.</description>
