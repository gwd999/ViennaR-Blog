Mateusz will give us an interesting introduction on Git(hub) and how to create and manage R-packages. 
The talk will cover the following points:

1. How to set up a git repository.
2. How create a basic R-package (or `package.skeleton`).
3. Set up continous integration using platforms like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), [Appveyor](http://www.appveyor.com/) or [Wercker](http://wercker.com/).
4. Set up code coverage using [Codecov](https://codecov.io), [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io).
5. Explain all those colourful badges ;)
