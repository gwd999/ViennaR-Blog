The goal of this tutorial was to demonstrate how to use Apache [SparkR](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.5.2/sparkr.html) for analyzing large-scale datasets in R. For demo purposes data extracted from the Bitcoin blockchain were used to produce a time series plot similar to [this](/img/blockchain_transactions.png) one.
