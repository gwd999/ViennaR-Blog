Deep learning with R using **mxnet**

<!--more-->

During the November ViennaR Meetup Klaudius Kalcher gave an excellent talk about the **mxnet** package. After covering some theoretical background he included examples to build deep neural networks from scratch. 
Finally, Mario showed some time series forecasting examples already discussing during the October Meetup using the **forecast** package.
